The examples I'm thinking of come from unofficial GW Facebook pages like Overheard or the newer Memes page. People make posts that are often meant to be humorous and sometimes reflect their political views. Then the comments erupt with people agreeing and disagreeing and occasionally the conversations go sour. They can be condescending towards people who hold specific views (either ""snowflakes"" or Trump supporters) they can be transphobic, they might be a misogynistic use of the word ""hun.""

And people liked it, but then some people noticed that she was white, and she fell into place with a lot of the things she included in her meme and they called her out for it. They dug up articles she had written and posts she had made on her own page in the past and posted the screenshots with the aim to point out the ironies. But it wasn't done in a ""Hey, think about how this is weird and maybe hypocritical."" It certainly seemed more aggressive, like it was meant to make her feel bad about it. And I'm not here to argue how appropriate the post was, or how conscious she was, whether it was a moment of blindness or one of humorous self-awareness. Nor I am here to say that white feminists are the true victims of online hate and they deserve more consideration when it comes to social movements or intersectionality; I'm aware of the inherent privileges in this situation.
